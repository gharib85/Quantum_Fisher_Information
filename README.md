# Quantum Fisher Information
The program calculates quantum fisher information (QFI) for variable-reflectivity beam-splitter estimation in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The phase in the system is kept constant and there is no photon loss throughout the simulation. Sine state can be generated using [SineState Generator.py](https://github.com/thehamzaq/Quantum_Fisher_Information/blob/master/SineState%20Generator.py). Here N stands for the number of photons being injected into the interferometer.

For details on QFI, please read [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2417). For more program-specific instructions, visit the two folders.
