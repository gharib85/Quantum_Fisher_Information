# Quantum Fisher Information
The program calculates quantum fisher information (QFI) for variable-reflectivity beam-splitter estimation in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The phase in the system is kept constant and there is no photon loss throughout the simulation. For details on QFI, please read [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2417).
