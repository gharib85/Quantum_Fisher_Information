# Hamming Weights

For the sine state and binomial input distributions, the program returns the probability distribution w.r.t Hamming weights given the number of photons involved. The input and the output distributions can then be compared using various techniques. Here N is the number of photons while Î¸ is the beam-splitter reflectivity.
