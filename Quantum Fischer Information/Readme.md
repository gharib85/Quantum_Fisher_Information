# QFI Simulator

This program calculates Quantum Fischer Information (QFI) for various input states. The QFI is usually computed for a non-entangled state (product state in this case) and an entangled state (sine state in this case) and the results are then compared. 

Here, the phase in the system is kept constant and there is no photon loss throughout the simulation. Also, N stands for the number of photons being injected into the interferometer. Once the QFI values are calculated, the scaling can easily be determined for a particular beam-splitter reflectivity value.
