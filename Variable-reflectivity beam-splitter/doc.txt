We implement evolutionary algorithm to the problem of variable-reflectivity beam-splitter estimation, which is an example of
quantum control problems. The aim of this project is to create a library containing modules that streamlines the construction
of an optimization algorithm for quantum control problems. Access to modules of optimization algorithms provides the building
blocks that users can use to tweak the algorithm to their needs.
